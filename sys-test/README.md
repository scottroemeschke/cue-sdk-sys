# sys-test

This crate includes a "sanity-check" style test to ensure basic functionality.

We perform a handshake and assert that the handshake was successful, and that the `sdkVersion`
value is what we expect.

# Running

In order to run the test, ensure you have followed the "Building" instructions in the primary crate README.
